# VIP2

# Introduction

Virus Identification Pipeline 2 (VIP2) is the newest version of VIP. VIP2 is an ultrafast and accurate virus identification computational pipleine based on combination of k-mer based and BW based aligners. VIP2 provides significant improvements to VIP1, with faster classification speeds and more accurate identification results. 

VIP2 was developed by Department of Core Facility, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (IVDC),  China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). This alpha release was tested by invited users.


# Key Features
Comprehensive Sequencing Results Supported. VIP2 can analyze reads from either Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or Third Generation Sequencing (TGS)

Transparent Results for Further Analysis. VIP2 provides the consensus sequence or confidence reads for final calls of virus. User can perform further analysis, such as re-checks through web blast.
